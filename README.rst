This is a fork from version 3.1.25 patched to remove the dependency `pytz>dev` from https://github.com/Optibus/celery/blob/patched/requirements/default.txt. 

The patch is in the branch called `patched`.

Do not change the `main` branch and don't delete this project until the legacy systems are migrated to python 3.
